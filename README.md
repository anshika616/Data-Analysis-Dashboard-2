## Process

1- Data Collection: Imported Amazon sales data from multiple sources (Excel/CSV) into Power BI.

2- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Used Power Query to clean data by removing duplicates, handling null values, correcting data types, and standardizing city, state, and category names.

3- Data Modeling: Created relationships between sales, product, and category tables to enable accurate analysis and filtering.

4- DAX Calculations: Built measures such as Total Sales, Filtered Sales, and Units Sold using DAX to answer key business questions.

5- Visual Creation: Designed KPI cards, bar charts, and slicers to analyze sales by city, state, category, product, and order status.

6- Interactivity: Added slicers, buttons, and page navigation to allow dynamic filtering and drill-down analysis.

7- Insights & Validation: Tested filters and visuals to ensure queries were answered correctly and insights were clear.
